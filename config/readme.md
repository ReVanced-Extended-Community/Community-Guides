#### reddit-automod-allowed-domains.yml
This is the config used for Reddit's automod to determine the links that are allowed in /r/revancedextended. You can adjust these settings in the Auto Moderator page inside the Mod Tools (for moderators only, of course).
Since this uses Regex matching rules, no human will be forced to update this manually. Use one of the suggested cloud LLMs ("AI") or a local one of choice to handle this.

Double check for possible [hallucinations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)) to make sure it's correct.

The rule is designed to maintain content quality and prevent links to potentially untrusted or irrelevant domains. The approved domains are predefined and include popular sites like GitHub, YouTube, and Discord, among others.
