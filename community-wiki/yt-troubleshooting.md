# **YT ReVanced Extended Troubleshooting**


> **For patching and installation troubleshooting, refer to the [general troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/community-wiki/general-troubleshooting.md).**


### **1. No internet connection / Home page not loading / Account sign-in issues**

Navigate to your device settings > Accounts > Manage accounts > Google ([blue icon](https://imgur.com/a/LXoLCV1)) > Remove account. You can sign in again if you want.

> If that doesn't work you can uninstall GmsCore and then reinstall [GmsCore](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases/latest).




### **2. The download feature isn't working**

Refer to section 2 of the [setup info guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/community-wiki/patching%20%26%20setup%20info.md#2-general-info-for-patching-and-feature-setup) to understand and set up the download feature.




### **3. Videos stop and buffer infinitely**

Make sure your YT ReVanced Extended is up-to-date.

If that does not solve it, open YT ReVanced Extended and navigate to Settings > ReVanced Extended > Miscellaneous > Spoof test client, **On**. Note that this will have many side effects.




### **4. YouTube Shorts are/aren't hidden**

**To hide/unhide Shorts in feeds:**

Go to Settings > ReVanced Extended > Shorts > Hide shorts shelf, **On/Off**.

**To hide/unhide the Shorts button:**

Go to Settings > ReVanced Extended > General > Navigation buttons > Hide shorts button, **On/Off**.




### **5. The player UI doesn't go away**

You may have set it to permanently show in Settings > Accessibility. Alternatively, this issue may be a bug which occurs randomly, and the only fix is to restart the app.




### **6. SponsorBlock is not working**

This likely means that the SponsorBlock servers are down. You can check the server status [here](https://status.sponsor.ajay.app/).




### **7. Watch history isn't being saved**

You must whitelist `s.youtube.com` in your ad-blocker, DNS-blocker, firewall, etc.
