# **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **1. What is ReVanced and ReVanced Extended?**

[ReVanced](https://revanced.app/) is a free modular patcher for Android apps such as YouTube. It can be used to create applications that have extra features and customizability, similar to how a browser extension works, but for apps.

ReVanced Extended (aka RVX) is a derivative project of ReVanced (not affiliated), consisting of patches made for YouTube, YT Music, and Reddit. It focuses on providing more features than the ReVanced patches. The founder of ReVanced Extended is [inotia00](https://github.com/inotia00), however, there are several forks/adaptions of ReVanced Extended made by other developers.



### **2. Is ReVanced Extended discontinued?**

Not currently. It has been in the past, but inotia00 is actively maintaining it at the moment.



### **3. How do I install a ReVanced Extended app?**

Refer to the [index of guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedextended/wiki/guide/).



### **4. Is ReVanced Extended safe?**

GmsCore, official patching tools, and the patches are all open-source. You can read the code and verify that it is safe.



### **5. Is `revancedextended.com` or `revanced.net` legitimate?**

No. All sites that distribute pre-patched / ready-to-use ReVanced Extended APKs are unofficial. APKs downloaded from such sites may contain malware or be outdated. If you signed in to Google using an APK from `revancedextended.com`, `revanced.net`, or any similar site, we recommend that you change your password and remove any devices that are signed in.



### **6. Why can't I just download a pre-made APK instead of patching it myself?**

It is illegal to distribute modified APKs. Anyone distributing pre-patched ReVanced or ReVanced Extended APKs is not related to ReVanced Extended and may be malicious. The safest way to install ReVanced Extended is by patching it yourself through one of the official methods.



### **7. What features are different between ReVanced Extended and ReVanced?**

The answer to this question is constantly evolving and there are too many differences in features to have them documented individually, so the best way to answer this question is by patching and installing the ReVanced Extended app you want to compare and see the differences for yourself. Alternatively, you can compare the list of patches between the [ReVanced Extended GitHub](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/tree/revanced-extended#readme) and the [ReVanced site](https://revanced.app/patches), but many patches contain several features and options within, so just comparing the list of patches won't reveal much.



### **8. Can I have ReVanced Extended and ReVanced apps installed simultaneously?**

If you patch with the non-root method, YouTube RVX and YT Music RVX will have a unique package name and will not conflict with any apps. But under normal conditions, Reddit ReVanced Extended and Reddit ReVanced will conflict.



### **9. How can I check the changelog?**

The release notes for patches can be found [here](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases).



### **10. How do I update a ReVanced Extended app?**

Generally, you update by patching the currently suggested version of the app and then installing it on top of the existing ReVanced Extended app as an update. Refer to section 1 in the [setup info guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/community-wiki/patching%20%26%20setup%20info.md#1-info-for-updating-revanced-extended) for in-depth info.
