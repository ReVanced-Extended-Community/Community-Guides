# **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **1. What is ReVanced and ReVanced Extended?**

[ReVanced](https://revanced.app/) is a free modular patcher for Android apps such as YouTube. It can be used to create applications that have extra features and customizability, similar to how a browser extension works, but for apps.

ReVanced Extended (aka RVX) is a derivative project of ReVanced (not affiliated), consisting of patches made for YouTube, YT Music, and Reddit. It focuses on providing more features than the ReVanced patches. The founder of ReVanced Extended is [inotia00](https://github.com/inotia00), however there are several forks/adaptions of ReVanced Extended made by other developers.



### **2. Is ReVanced Extended discontinued?**

Not currently. It has been in the past, but inotia00 is actively maintaining it at the moment.



### **3. Is ReVanced Extended safe?**

GmsCore, official patching tools, and the patches are all open-source. You can read the code and verify that it is safe.



### **4. How do I get ReVanced Extended?**

Refer to the [index of guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedextended/wiki/guide/).



### **5. Is revancedextended.com or revanced.net legitimate?**

No. All sites that distribute pre-patched / ready-to-use ReVanced Extended APKs are unofficial. If you signed in to Google using an APK from revancedextended.com, revanced.net, or any similar site, we recommend that you change your password and remove any devices that are signed in.



### **6. Why can't I just download a pre-made APK instead of patching it myself?**

Due to legal reasons, ReVanced Extended APKs cannot be directly distributed. Anyone distributing pre-patched ReVanced or ReVanced Extended APKs is not official and potentially malicious. The only truly safe way to install ReVanced Extended is by patching it yourself through one of the official methods.



### **7. What features are different between ReVanced Extended and ReVanced?**

The best way to answer this is by patching and installing the ReVanced Extended app you want to compare and see the differences directly. 

However, you can check what the patches do on [this page](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Patches-Documentation#patches-documentation) (note that it is a work-in-progress). You can also check what all of the toggles in the patched ReVanced Extended apps do on [this page](https://kazimmt.github.io/#revanced-extended-features) (also a work-in-progress). Alternatively, you can compare the list of patches between the [ReVanced Extended GitHub](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/tree/revanced-extended#readme) and the [ReVanced site](https://revanced.app/patches), but keep in mind that some patches can contain several features and options within, so just comparing the list of patches won't reveal much.



### **8. Can I have ReVanced Extended and ReVanced apps installed simultaneously?**

If you patch with the non-root method, YouTube ReVanced Extended and YT Music RVX will have a unique package name and will not conflict with any apps. But under normal conditions, Reddit ReVanced Extended and Reddit ReVanced will conflict.



### **9. How do I update ReVanced Extended?**

Generally, you update by patching the currently suggested version of the app and then installing it on top of the existing ReVanced Extended app as an update. You can refer to section 1 in the [setup info guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/community-wiki/patching%20%26%20setup%20info.md#1-info-for-updating-revanced-extended) for in-depth info.
