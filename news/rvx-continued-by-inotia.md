# Good news, Inotia is back!

As you can see [new patches](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.190.1) were released earlier today with a sizeable changelog.

For the most part, expect patches to be released slower with focus on keeping the current features working and not so much on adding new features.

*Issue Center repository for bug reports/feedback will be opened again starting tomorrow.*

# Here's the plan:

YouTube:

* Fixes for minimal bugs
* No new features will be added

YT Music:

* New features are scheduled to be added
* Ongoing maintenance management
