## Since new patches that Inotia was working on privately were released to the public on September 5th, 2023, the archiving of this subreddit will be slightly delayed. Expect it to happen at the end of the month. 

## This subreddit will be Archived (read-only) starting September 10th

### What does that mean for the subreddit?
  
You will still be able to read and search for all the existing posts here, as well as the Wiki for useful information, but no new posts will be able to be submitted.

### Why is this happening?

As it stands, the ReVanced Extended project is discontinued indefinitely and is not going to receive new features or updates. [Read more about the discontinuation here.](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation/wiki/Announcement)

Furthermore, we believe that nearly all relevant questions and issues related to the ReVanced Extended project have been answered and can be found using the search function. You can filter posts using the "Post Flairs" (tags) to make searching easier.

### When will it happen?

Starting September 10th 2023.

### What about RVX/ReX support?

This has already been previously discussed with Inotia, and it was decided that the Telegram groups would remain for community support. The ReVanced Extended Chat channel also has support for the new fork of RVX, called **ReX** and made by u/ChanceActual3131. It offers support for newer versions and some new fixes may be added to it as they are ready.
