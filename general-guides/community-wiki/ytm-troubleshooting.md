# **YT Music Extended Troubleshooting**



### **1. No internet connection / Home page not loading / Account sign-in issues**

Navigate to your device settings > Accounts > Manage accounts > Google (blue icon) > Remove account. You can sign in again if you want.

> If that doesn't work make sure you have the latest version of [GmsCore](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases/latest) installed.




### **2. The download feature isn't working**

Refer to section 2 of the [setup info guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/general-guides/community-wiki/patching%20%26%20setup%20info.md#2-general-app-and-feature-setup) to understand and set up the download function in YTM Extended.





### **3. How do I get YTM Extended on Android Auto?**

Refer to section 3 of the [setup guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/general-guides/community-wiki/patching%20%26%20setup%20info.md#3-yt-music-setup).





### **4. Why can I only use the Radio feature?**

Google has made it so that Canadian users who do not have YT Premium can only use the Radio feature within YouTube Music.

Refer to step 3b of the [setup info guide](https://github.com/ReVanced-Extended-Community/Community-Guides/blob/main/general-guides/community-wiki/patching%20%26%20setup%20info.md#3b-spoof-app-version-setup-for-canadian-users) to solve this.




### **5. App crashes on startup**

If the app is crashing on startup and you've already followed the general troubleshooting steps, then the likely issue is the email you are signing in with has parental control restrictions.
