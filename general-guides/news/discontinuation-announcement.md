Announcement
==
As I announced before, RVX has been discontinued since _August 5, 2023_

I'll leave a simple Q&A
___
### Q. Why was the RVX project discontinued?
### A. I need a little explanation. I'd appreciate it if you read it.

**#1. first reason**

Revanced projects only publish source code, but does not provide pre-built APKs.

In other words, creating a built APK is what each user should do.

This is why the DMCA take-down issue could be avoided and the project could continue.

RVX, too, has been branched from ReVanced, so it follows this ideology.

**Some illegal websites have begun to distribute pre-built APKs without understanding the ideology of these ReVanced projects, which can pose a fatal threat to the project from a long-term perspective.**

In addition, there is no way to determine what potential risks are contained in pre-built APKs distributed from illegal websites.

In the github repo for RVX users to receive issues or suggestions, I have learned that many users are using a pre-built APKs downloaded from illegal websites.

I have no way of stopping the pre-built APK distribution of these illegal websites, and the only thing I could do was discontinue the project.


**#2. second reason**

I wanted to make an open source through Reversing Engineering for everything that TeamVanced implemented in the last 3 years

And I constantly Reversing Engineering for about a year and finally succeeded in implementing most of the features as open source.

I have already achieved my purpose.

Since all the features are implemented as open source, anyone can continue the subsequent project if there is a little programming knowledge.

___
### Q. What should we do in the future?
### A. RVX patches will no longer be updated

You can continue to use the last supported version of RVX patches, `YouTube v18.30.37`, until it no longer works.

If it stops working, simply migrate to the [official ReVanced](https://github.com/revanced)

They're a Team, so you'll be able to get even more long-term support from them

In the case of YouTube Music, quite dynamic fingerprints were used, so you can still patch latest YouTube Music without an update from RVX patches

___
### Q. Do RVX related communities close?
### A. Only github is closed

[Telegram Group](https://t.me/revanced_extended) and [sub-Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/revancedextended) will still be managed

Even after RVX is discontinued, users in the community can share their issues or get help from each other

___
### The RVX Project could never be continued by myself

- `ReVanced Team`, which established a framework for converting all source code to open source

- `Revancify`, which presented a Python based build tool, and `Decipher`, the maintainer

- `ReVanced Builder`, which presented a Node JS based build tool, and `Reis`, the maintainer

- `AunAli`, who helped ReVanced Manager to be compatible with my patches

- `OxrxL`, which has been a maintainer of Vanced Music, who helped fix numerous issues until recently

- `Team NewPipe`, who has been instrumental in fixing playback issues in the MicroG build

- `Hlytus`, `KobeW50`, `SpacellaryUS` - Subreddit moderators - which contributed greatly to the activation of sub-Reddit

- `Telegram Group managers`, who helped RVX last for more than a year in a variety of ways

- And numerous `Crowdin translation contributors` who contributed to the localization of each region

**I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone**
