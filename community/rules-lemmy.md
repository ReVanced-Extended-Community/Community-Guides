**1. No Package Downloads From Unofficial Sources:**

The home for the ReVanced Extended project is only **github.com/inotia00** and its repositories. All other sources/webistes that seek to distribute RVX APKs are unrelated to the project and can be malicious. Use them at your own risk. We also are unable to provide support for them. These shouldn't be **encouraged** or **shared**.

Treat fellow members with respect and courtesy. Harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated.

**3. Stay on Topic:**

Keep discussions related to ReVanced Extended (RVX), its features, updates, and improvements. Irrelevant or off-topic posts may be removed.

**4. No Spam or Self-Promotion:**

Avoid excessive self-promotion or spamming the community with links to external content. Genuine contributions are welcome.

**5. Be Helpful and Informative:**

Encourage constructive discussions and help others with their questions or issues related to ReVanced Extended.

**6. No inappropriate content or Excessive Profanity:**

This community is visited by people of all ages, please avoid excessive profanity and by no means post or share content with nudity, gore or that's generally considered NSFW.

**7. Reporting and Moderation:**

If you come across any content that violates these rules or any suspicious activity, report it to the moderators for review.

**8. Respect the Rules and Decisions:**

Adhere to these rules and respect the decisions made by the moderators. Discussions about rule changes are welcome, but they should be done constructively.
